# M3 > Deployed App

For this milestone and project, you will work in teams of 3 people.

You will complete the functionality of your startup application, and host the application on a publically accessible server.

**Due Dates:**

* In-class video presentation of complete application due: Friday, November 19th.
* Complete M3, due Monday, November 29th, before midnight.

## General Tasks

* Implement dashboard and site instrumentation (BONUS).
* Implement and execute runbook for deploying site.
* Acceptance tests (complete remaining app functionality).

### üìà  Dashboard and site instrumentation

Implement a real-time dashboard for your application, accessible at `/dashboard`. The dashboard should describe real-time information such as active pages and number of visitors, summary metrics of underlying application data, or other relevant information assist with understanding real-time application usage.

##### Constraints

* Use websockets to broadcast changes to dashboard.
* Limit clarifying questions on what to implement as this is an optional bonus feature.

### üéõÔ∏è  Implement and execute runbook for deploying site üñ•Ô∏è  

Provision a publically accessible server.

Create a runbook (a document with executable step-by-step instructions) that deploys your application to the server. 

Ensure that your runbook describes how to:
* Install necessary components (packages, database, etc.), 
* Package your web application 
* Describes updating any settings in configuration files for database or web server.
* Start server processes 

##### Constraints

* The deployed application should be packaged üì¶ as a bundle, not running a development server.
* Configure a nginx server to serve web traffic and route backend requests to running api server.
* The deployed website should be running until teaching staff has evaluated functionality.
* A registered domain name is not necessary.

### Acceptance tests (complete remaining app functionality).

Create an acceptance test page with written instructions for evaluting the functionality of your app. Ensure a process for registering an account is documented, or existing user login credentials are provided for TA.

For each step, the acceptance test should provide concrete instructions on: 
* What to actions to perform, 
* Data to enter or location to navigate to,
* and information to verify

Ensure complete coverage of your application is achieved (e.g. all implemented pages are visited or  workflow is completed).

### Exploratory Testing and Code Inspection

You must not hard-code interaction/mock data for your app. TAs will perform additional exploratory testing and code inspection to verify app performs as expected.

Failure to adhere to these instructions will result in a 0 for this milestone.

##### Constraints

* Your app should remain running in your deployed environment and be available for acceptance testing at any time after the milestone deadline to the final exam.
* If acceptance testing cannot be performed on a deployed server and needs to be manually demoed, a -30 penalty will occur.

### Final report

In your submission's README.md, provide a final report of your project.

Prepare a report that summarizes:

* The problem your app solved
* Your reflection on the development process and project.
* Any limitations and future work.

## Team responsibilities

### üë• Task leaders 

Each major task should have a team member responsible for implementing the majority of the assigned task.

Use your GitHub Project Board (e.g. Milestone1) to help coordinate and assign tasks.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._

## Evaluation

* Dashboard and site instrumentation. (+20%)
* Implement and execute runbook for deploying site. (30%)
* Acceptance tests (complete remaining app functionality). (50%)
* Final report and GitHub Project tracking. (10%)
* Screencast demostrates each task [5--15 minutes, total]. (10%)

Points may be deducted for not following constraints, poor quality of implementation, poor task communication and delegation, or failing to include sufficient detail required to evaluate capabilities.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._

## Submission

Commit your all your work related to your project into your designated repository in the main branch before the final deadline.

Ensure your repository contains:

* Deployed site address and acceptance test instructions.
* a README.md, with your final report details.
* code and configuration for web app
* a link to screencast that demostrates each milesone task.

**Due Dates**
* In-class video presentation of complete application due: Friday, November 19th.
* Complete M3, due Monday, November 29th, before midnight.
