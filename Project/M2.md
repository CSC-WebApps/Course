# M2 > Most-an-App

For this milestone and project, you will work in teams of 3 people.

You will implement most of the functionality of your startup application, including back-end functionality.

**Due Monday, November 1st, before midnight.**

## General Tasks

* Implement login.
* Implement front-end (50--80%) with a web framework.
* Implement back-end (50--80%) with node.js/express.

### ðŸ”’  Login

Complete a login workflow for your application. Include the following components in your login page:

* Create user account or third-party login.
* Login form
* Logout

##### Constraints

* Prevent access to application pages without valid login.
* If storing user account passwords, store only salted hashes of passwords.


### ðŸŽ¨ Front-end (50--80%) with web framework ðŸš§  

Implement 50--80% of pages/components required for a minium viable product of your startup.

##### Constraints

* Use one of the following web frameworks: Angular, Vue, React.

### ðŸ“¦  Back-end (50--80%) with node.js/express.

Implement 50--80% of your routes.

##### Constraints

* Use a REST-based architectural style for your back-end.
* Limited use of mock data.

### Milestone report

In your submission's README.md, provide a report of your progress. Include the following information:

* What's done.
* What's not done.
* List all the pages/components of the web app. Provide wireframes for pages not complete.
* List all the endpoints of the web app. For each endpoint, provide a description of the route, and expected behavior of the endpoint.

You might find using a markdown table useful, such as the following:

| Pages   | Status      | Wireframe
| ------- | -------     | ---------
| Login   | Incomplete  | [wireframe]()
| Profile | âœ…          |
| Match   | âœ…          |
| Payment | Incomplete  | [wireframe]()
| Tasks   | âœ…          |
| Manage  | Incomplete  | [wireframe]()


## Team responsibilities

### ðŸ‘¥ Task leaders 

Each major task should have a team member responsible for implementing the majority of the assigned task.

Use your GitHub Project Board (e.g. Milestone1) to help coordinate and assign tasks.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._


### Checkpoint, October 27th

Teaching staff will inspect repository and GitHub Project activity, run code, or potentially ask for a team to demonstrate progress, on the checkpoint date.

Teaching staff will provide helpful feedback or suggestions if they identify any significant problems.

ðŸš¨ Failure to have any meaningful code or task progress will result in a -20% penalty!

## Evaluation

* Implement login. (20%)
* Implement front-end (50--80%) with a web framework. (30%)
* Implement back-end (50--80%) with node.js/express. (20%)
* Milestone report (with wireframes/endpoints). (15%)
* Checkpoint and GitHub Project tracking. (5%)
* Screencast demostrates each task [5--15 minutes, total]. (10%)

Points may be deducted for not following constraints, poor quality of implementation, poor task communication and delegation, or failing to include sufficient detail required to evaluate capabilities.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._

**Checkpoint failure: -20%**

## Submission

Commit your all your work related to your project into your designated repository in the main branch before the final deadline. 

When you have finished the submission, create a branch called `M2` to hold a snapshot of your work related to this milestone, allowing you to continue work on future milestones on the main branch.

Ensure your repository contains:

* a README.md, with your milestone report details.
* code and configuration for web app
* a link to screencast that demostrates each milesone task.

**Due Monday, November 1st, before midnight.**
