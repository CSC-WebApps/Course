# M1 > Half-an-App

For this milestone and project, you will work in teams of 3 people.

You will implement roughly half of the functionality of your startup application.

**Due Friday, October 15th, before midnight.**

## General Tasks

* Implement landing page and wireframes.
* Implement front-end (30--50%) with a web framework.
* Implement back-end (30--50%) with node.js/express [mock].

### üåê  Landing page

Complete a landing page for your startup. This will help you describe the goal and value of your application.

Incorporate the following elements (but not limited to) into the design of your landing page:

* Unique Selling Proposition (headline, supporting text)
* A hero image
* The benefits of your offering.
* Lead generation form (call to action)

##### Constraints

* Use bootstrap-based css.
* Page should be responsive.
* Maintain good page aesthetics (colors, whitespace, alignment).

### üé® Front-end (30--50%) with web framework üöß  

If not already completed, create a complete set of wireframes for the pages of your web application.

Implement 30--50% of pages/components required for a minium viable product of your startup.

##### Constraints

* Use one of the following web frameworks: Angular, Vue, React.

### üì¶  Back-end (30--50%) with node.js/express [mock].

Design a set of REST endpoints for your application.

Implement 30--50% of your routes.

##### Constraints

* Use a REST-based architectural style for your back-end.
* For this milestone, mock data/mock returns are acceptable---however, eventually persistance and real functionality will be required.

### Milestone report

In your submission's README.md, provide a report of your progress. Include the following information:

* What's done.
* What's not done.
* List all the pages/components of the web app. Provide wireframes for pages not complete.
* List all the endpoints of the web app. For each endpoint, provide a description of the route, and expected behavior of the endpoint.

You might find using a markdown table useful, such as the following:

| Pages   | Status      | Wireframe
| ------- | -------     | ---------
| Login   | Incomplete  | [wireframe]()
| Profile | ‚úÖ          |
| Match   | ‚úÖ          |
| Payment | Incomplete  | [wireframe]()
| Tasks   | ‚úÖ          |
| Manage  | Incomplete  | [wireframe]()


## Team responsibilities

### üë• Task leaders 

Each major task should have a team member responsible for implementing the majority of the assigned task.

Use your GitHub Project Board (e.g. Milestone1) to help coordinate and assign tasks.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._


### Checkpoint, October 6th

Teaching staff will inspect repository and GitHub Project activity, run code, or potentially ask for a team to demonstrate progress, on the checkpoint date.

Teaching staff will provide helpful feedback or suggestions if they identify any significant problems.

üö® Failure to have any meaningful code or task progress will result in a -20% penalty!

## Evaluation

* Implement landing page. (20%)
* Implement front-end (30--50%) with a web framework. (30%)
* Implement back-end (30--50%) with node.js/express [mock]. (20%)
* Milestone report (with wireframes/endpoints). (15%)
* Checkpoint and GitHub Project tracking. (5%)
* Screencast demostrates each task [5--15 minutes, total]. (10%)

Points may be deducted for not following constraints, poor quality of implementation, poor task communication and delegation, or failing to include sufficient detail required to evaluate capabilities.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._

**Checkpoint failure: -20%**

## Submission

Commit your all your work related to your project into your designated repository in the main branch before the final deadline. 

When you have finished the submission, create a branch called `M1` to hold a snapshot of your work related to this milestone, allowing you to continue work on future milestones on the main branch.

Ensure your repository contains:

* a README.md, with your milestone report details.
* code and configuration for web app
* a link to screencast that demostrates each milesone task.

**Due Friday, October 15th, before midnight.**
