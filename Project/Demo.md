# Demo (5%)

Prepare a 3--5 minute video demonstrating your application. Focus on illustrating the problem and the primary workflow of using the application. If extra time you can discuss any additional interesting aspects of your project such as technology, dashboard, or extra features.

This video will be shown in class. You will want to consider using video editing, diagrams, transitions, and high quality audio recording to produce your video.

At least one team member should be available to answer questions and provide clarifications during the presentation.

Provide the link to your video before class (11/19):
