## Objectives

Students are expected to gain practical exposure to concepts, tools, and technology associated with web development through hands-on projects.  Lectures will include workshop style learning experiences, where students get to work on a problemset and receive feedback from the instructor and other classmates.

## Course Overview

In the course, a mixture of traditional lectures with activities and in-class workshops will be used.  During lectures, we will cover core concepts related to a topic. During the in-class workshops, we will perform sample exercises with relevant tools that reinforce lecture material.

### Homeworks

Homework assignments will be regularly released throughout the semester and reinforce class material.  Homeworks will typically mirror a scenario or common task that a developer may face.

### Project

Students will work in teams to design, develop, and deploy a web application. The project will incorporate elements learned throughout the semester. The project will be have several milestones that will be evaluated for grading. Details on requirements for milestones will be released throughout the course. A final demo of the web application will be presented at the end of the semester by each team.

### Final exam

A final exam will cover conceptual knowledge of material covered in lectures as well as an evaluation of application, implementation, compare + contrast, and design of applications, techniques, and tools related to web development.

## Course Grading

| Category           | Weight |
|--------------------|--------|
| Homework           | 35%    |
| Final Exam         | 25%    |
| **Final Project**  | 40%    |

The Final Project will be evaluated across multiple milestones.

#### Grade Scale

Based on your Weighted Course Average (WCA), you will receive the following letter grade.

| Grade | Range         |

## Resources

## Late Policy
No late assignments will be accepted. Many of your assignments will be collaborative
effort with other members of your group. Thus, late papers by one member
of the group will affect the entire group. The due date for assignments will be
posted on the assignment and will generally be submitted electronically.

## Teaching Philosophy
We will make use of intensive classroom activities and readings. You will be expected to participate actively in discussions. On any given issue, you may be asked to summarize and criticize reading assignments from the text or articles that you have read for your assignments and projects. We view the web as a valuable
resource. Our course website will serve as our ”information system” this semester; you will be expected to visit the site on a daily basis for updates and to obtain your homework / project assignments. Only you can learn. As the instructors, we can only guide and assist you. Thus, all of the class activities are aimed at helping you learn.

## Academic Integrity
The course will follow all NCSU academic [integrity regulations](http://www.ncsu.edu/provost/academic_policies). All students are expected to maintain traditional standards of academic integrity by giving proper credit for all work. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued. A student shall be guilty of a violation of academic integrity if he or she represents the work of others as his or her own or aid another’s misrepresentation.
Any violation associated with a homework/lab assignment, project
deliverable, examination or quiz will result in a failing grade for the course. Such violations will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct, which may impose penalties beyond those by the instructors.

We encourage you to read the ACM Code of Ethics, particularly Sections 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 2.2 and 2.4. (http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html)

## Equity Policy

All persons, regardless of age, race, religion, gender, physical disability or sexual orientation shall have equal opportunity without harassment in this course. Any harassment should be reported immediately to the instructor.

The course will follow all NCSU regulations relevant to students with disabilities. Any students requiring additional assistance due to disabilities (e.g., learning disabilities), should contact the professor during the first week of the semester. Students requiring extra time for examinations and quizzes are asked to make
arrangements at least three days in advance. You may contact the NCSU Disability Services for Students Office regarding campus services at the Student Health Center for more information and assistance (http://www.ncsu.edu/dso/students/).

## Course Evaluation

Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of class. Students will receive an email message directing them to a website where they can login using their Unity ID and complete evaluations. All evaluations are confidential; instructors will never know how any one student responded to any question, and students will never know the ratings for any particular instructors.
