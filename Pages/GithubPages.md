### Creating gh-pages

You can create a new branch using `git branch gh-pages`. Do you remember which command we should use to switch branches?

Use `git switch gh-pages`. You should see that you have switched to the gh-pages branch. Confirm with `git branch`. You should see an asterisk next to gh-pages.

Push your changes.

### Viewing GitHub Pages

You should now be able to see your html file on GitHub!

For GitHub, your page will be available at the following url:

```
http://<user>.github.io/<repo>/index.html
```

For example, see:

* website: http://startupbot.github.io/MobileTouch/  
* gh-pages: https://github.com/StartupBot/MobileTouch/tree/gh-pages 

For GitHub Enterprise, your page will be available at the following url:

```
http://pages.github.ncsu.edu/<user>/<repo>/index.html
```
